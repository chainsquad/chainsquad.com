How to built autonomous companies base on the building blocks of modern
blockchain systems. But what does it take to build a *company* on the
blockchain? How similar are these to regular companies and where are the
differences? What needs to be considered when building one from legal point of
view? Can a decentralized system even make profit and if so, what can be done
with it?

These any many more questions are addressed in this presentation and should
provide the audience with sufficient material to construct a decentralized
company on paper.
