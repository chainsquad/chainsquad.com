How a secure and public accounting system for BitShares' worker proposal system
has been developed and operated.

As one of the core developers of this system, we provided insights into the
internal accounting structure, the operations that took place on the chain, the
transparency provided, in particular with the accounting part, as well as
some security aspects, such as multi-signature account security.
