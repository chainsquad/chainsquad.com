### Cookies
To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files
called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or
mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to
remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font
size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t
have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or
browse from one page to another.

### Google Analytics
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use
of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often
users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what
other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the
information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site.
Google Analytics collects only the IP-address assigned to you on the
date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying
information. We do not combine the information collected through the use
of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.  Although
Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to
identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the
cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and
share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to
this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of
Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and the [Google Privacy
Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html).

We want to remark that this page uses "anonymizeIp" to protect your
identity.
